## About me

I am currently a Research Assistant Professor at Northwestern University. Prior to joining Northwestern University, I was a Research Associate in the Department of Communication Science and Disorders at the University of Pittsburgh, where I also obtained my PhD investigating self-perceived listening difficulties in adults with normal hearing. I completed my undergraduate training at the University of Texas at Austin, where I received a Bachelor of Science in Psychology and completed an honors thesis in Cognitive Neuroscience. 

My research program focuses on the neural mechanisms underlying speech processing challenges using an interdisciplinary, multimodal neurophysiological, and cognitive computational neuroscience approach. I combine my background in psychology and cognitive neuroscience with my training in neurobiology, otolaryngology, audiology, and clinical translational sciences to answer questions about the neurobiology underlying difficulties with speech perception in noisy environments. I am particularly interested in middle-aged adults, which is a time when speech perception difficulties begin to arise but hearing thresholds remain within clinically normal limits. My long-term research goal is to develop neurobiologically informed rehabilitative and individualized approaches for speech perception in noise difficulties in adults with subclinical hearing loss.

I have secured over $850,000 in funding from the National Institutes of Health, with most of this funding used to investigate speech perception challenges in aging and in individuals who complain of speech perception difficulties but have clinically-normal hearing thresholds. 

In my spare time, you'll find me outdoors with my husband, son, and dog, no matter the season!
