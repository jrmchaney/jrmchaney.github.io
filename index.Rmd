## Bio

I am a PhD candidate in Communication Science and Disorders at the University 
of Pittsburgh. Broadly, I am interested in the neural mechanisms of aging, hearing, and cognition on speech processing. I use a combination of behavioral, neurophysiological, and computational cognitive neuroscience approaches to conduct my research. I am funded by an NIH F31-Diversity National Research Service Award (1F31DC020085-01A1) entitled *Neural mechanisms of speech perception in noise in middle-age* (2022-2025).
