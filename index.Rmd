## About me

I am a Research Assistant Professor at Northwestern University. Prior to joining Northwestern University, I earned my PhD in Communication Science and Disorders at the University of Pittsburgh, where I investigated self-perceived listening difficulties in adults with normal hearing.

My research program focuses on the neural mechanisms underlying speech processing challenges using an interdisciplinary, multimodal neurophysiological, and cognitive computational neuroscience approach. I combine my background in psychology and cognitive neuroscience with my training in neuroscience, audiology, and clinical translational sciences to answer questions about the neurobiology underlying difficulties with speech perception in noisy environments. My long-term research goal is to develop neurobiologically informed rehabilitative and individualized approaches for speech perception in noise difficulties in adults with subclinical hearing loss.

I have secured over $1 million in funding, with the majority to investigate speech perception challenges in aging and in individuals who complain of speech perception difficulties but have clinically-normal hearing thresholds. 

In my spare time, you'll find me outdoors with my husband, kids, and dog, no matter the season!
