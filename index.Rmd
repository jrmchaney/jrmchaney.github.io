## Bio

I am a Research Assistant Professor at Northwestern University studying auditory neuroscience. I received my PhD in Communication Science and Disorders from the University of Pittsburgh.

My research focuses on the neurobiology and plasticity underlying speech processing using neurophysiological (EEG, pupillometry, peripheral nerve stimulation) and cognitive computational neuroscience approaches. My research goals are to develop neurobiologically-informed rehabilitative approaches for speech perception in noise challenges. My current research aims to develop a mechanistic understanding of the neural mechanisms underlying individual differences in speech perception in noise in aging.

I have secured over $250,000 from the National Institutes of Health to investigate speech perception challenges in aging and in individuals who complain of speech perception difficulties but have clinically-normal hearing thresholds. I leverage audiological protocols, cutting-edge neurophysiological methods, and neurobiologically-grounded computational models to gain a better understanding of the source of speech perception challenges in the absence of overt hearing loss.
