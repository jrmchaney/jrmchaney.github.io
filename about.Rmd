## Research Areas

Over the last decade, I have led and collaborated on myriad projects. Below, you'll find a synopsis of these projects and my contributions.

    <summary><h4> Neural Mechanisms of Speech Perception in Aging </h4></summary>
    <p>Speech perception in noise becomes increasingly difficult with age. Even with normal hearing sensitivity, older adults can vary widely in speech perception performance. Often times speech perception difficulties become prominent in middle-age (~40-55 years) when hearing thresholds are still considered within clinically normal limits. A significant contribution of my research has focused on the individual differences underlying speech processing in middle-aged and older adults while considering contributions from audibility and cognition. I used a combination of neurophysiological, computational, and machine learning methods to examine how the neural mechanisms of speech perception change with age.

During my PhD studies, I was awarded a $145,000 fellowship from the National Institutes of Health to promote diversity in biomedical research to investigate speech perceptoin in noise in middle-aged adults. This line of work has resulted in several publications:

    <summary><h4>Cognitive-Decisional Strategies Underlying Speech Perception</h4></summary>
    <p>With increasing age, difficulties in speech perception in noise are associated with increased activity in a compensatory network of frontal-motor regions involved in cognitive-decisional processes and reduced activity in core auditory sensory-perceptual network. In additions with increasing age, some adults tend to compensate for the noisy core auditory network activity by increasing the reliance on supportive visual or lexical-semantic contextual cues. Thus, when listening to speech stimuli in noise, younger adults rely on clear and stable (bottom-up) speech representations in auditory regions and older adults tend to leverage higher-level (top-down) compensatory mechanisms that require additional working memory and cognitive resources. While neuroimaging methodologies have the potential to identify compensatory network changes, these methods are not a scalable solution â€“ they are difficult to deploy in audiology clinics and are cost prohibitive. This line of work aims to understand the sensory-cognitive deficits that drive speech perceptual challenges under different listening conditions in younger and middle-aged adults. The overarching goal is to develop behavioral-based assessments of underlying sensory-cognitive computational processes during speech perception in noise that can complement clinical audiology, inform rehabilitation approaches and counseling, and serve as biomarkers of targeted rehabilitation.

    <summary><h4>Biological Markers of Speech Processing and Plasticity</h4></summary>
    <p>A significant challenge in speech perception is the process of categorizing speech sounds into discrete classes. Despite this challenge, speech categorization is rapid and automatic for native speech sounds. However, learning novel speech categories in adulthood is substantially more effortful and challenging. The aim of this line of work is two-fold: 1) examine the neural mechanisms underlying novel speech sound categorization and 2) examine interventions for enhancing plasticity to novel speech categories in adulthood.

    <summary><h4>Diagnostic Tests of Speech Perception Challenges in Adults with Normal Hearing</h4></summary>
    <p>Hearing loss is a significant issue impacting 1.5 billion people worldwide. However, traditional diagnostic methods like the audiogram often miss a critical subset of the population, ~10% of adults, who experience difficulties in understanding speech despite having normal hearing on the gold standard audiogram. This line of work aims to address the unmet need by developing new, non-invasive diagnostic tools that can detect the sources of speech perception difficulties in adults with normal hearing.
