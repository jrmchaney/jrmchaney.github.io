Even with normal hearing sensitivity, older adults\n            can vary widely in speech perception performance. Often\n            times speech perception difficulties become prominent in\n            middle-age (~40-55 years) when hearing thresholds are still\n            considered within clinically normal limits. A significant\n            contribution of my research has focused on the individual\n            differences underlying speech processing in middle-aged and\n            older adults while considering contributions from audibility\n            and cognition. I used a combination of neurophysiological,\n            computational, and machine learning methods to examine how\n            the neural mechanisms of speech perception change with\n            age.\n            During my PhD studies, I was awarded a $145,000\n            fellowship from the National Institutes of Health to promote\n            diversity in biomedical research to investigate speech\n            perceptoin in noise in middle-aged adults.

Scientific Reports.\n            \n            Cognitive-Decisional Strategies Underlying Speech Perception\n            \n            \n            With increasing age, difficulties in speech perception in\n            noise are associated with increased activity in a\n            compensatory network of frontal-motor regions involved in\n            cognitive-decisional processes and reduced activity in core\n            auditory sensory-perceptual network. In additions with\n            increasing age, some adults tend to compensate for the noisy\n            core auditory network activity by increasing the reliance on\n            supportive visual or lexical-semantic contextual cues. Thus,\n            when listening to speech stimuli in noise, younger adults\n            rely on clear and stable (bottom-up) speech representations\n            in auditory regions and older adults tend to leverage\n            higher-level (top-down) compensatory mechanisms that require\n            additional working memory and cognitive resources. While\n            neuroimaging methodologies have the potential to identify\n            compensatory network changes, these methods are not a\n            scalable solution – they are difficult to deploy in\n            audiology clinics and are cost prohibitive. This line of\n            work aims to understand the sensory-cognitive deficits that\n            drive speech perceptual challenges under different listening\n            conditions in younger and middle-aged adults. The\n            overarching goal is to develop behavioral-based assessments\n            of underlying sensory-cognitive computational processes\n            during speech perception in noise that can complement\n            clinical audiology, inform rehabilitation approaches and\n            counseling, and serve as biomarkers of targeted\n            rehabilitation.\n            Associated References:\n            McHaney, J.

However, traditional diagnostic\n              methods like the audiogram often miss a critical subset of\n              the population, ~10% of adults, who experience\n              difficulties in understanding speech despite having normal\n              hearing on the gold standard audiogram.
