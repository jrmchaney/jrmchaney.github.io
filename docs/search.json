Below, you’ll find a synopsis of these\n            projects and my contributions.\n            \n            Neural Mechanisms of Speech Perception in Aging\n            \n            \n            One in ten adult patients who seek help from an\n            audiologist for speech perception difficulties have\n            clinically normal hearing. This line of work aims to\n            understand the neural basis of speech perception challenges\n            in younger, middle-aged, and older adults that cannot be\n            explained by hearing thresholds on an audiogram. In McHaney\n            et al., 2021, we used EEG to show that cortical tracking of\n            speech by delta band oscillations is a robust neural\n            correlate of speech-in-noise comprehension in older adults\n            beyond the effects of audibility and working memory. In\n            subsequent studies we systematically examined bottom-up\n            sensory and top-down cognitive processes involved in speech\n            perception through a comprehensive audiological and\n            neurophysiological assessment. We demonstrated that\n            middle-aged adults with normal hearing show less distinctive\n            neural encoding of phonemes (Guo, McHaney et al., 2025) and\n            less specialized cortical processing of suprasegmental\n            prosodic features in the auditory cortex (McHaney et al.,\n            revisions in review) compared to younger adults. These\n            findings are consistent with age-related neural\n            dedifferentiation in middle-aged adults, which has\n            previously only been considered in older adults.\n            To examine a mechanistic cause for such age-related\n            neural dedifferentiation in middle-age, we used a\n            cross-species design and linked electrophysiological\n            measures of perceptual decline in middle-aged adults to\n            histologically confirmed cochlear neural degeneration in a\n            Mongolian gerbil animal model (Zink, Zhen, McHaney et al.,\n            2025). We also found that this perceptual decline in humans\n            resulted in a concomitant increase in listening effort, as\n            indexed by pupillary responses. These findings offer a\n            neural basis for early listening fatigue and conversational\n            disengagement in middle-age.\n            Although challenges with phoneme encoding, prosody\n            encoding, and listening effort emerge in adults with\n            clinically normal audiograms, they have direct implications\n            for individuals who use hearing aids or cochlear implants.\n            Hearing aids and cochlear implants are designed to optimize\n            audibility, yet this line of research shows that speech\n            perception difficulties can stem from degraded neural\n            representations of phonemes and prosody, as well as\n            increased reliance on cognitive resources. These neural and\n            cognitive bottlenecks may limit the extent to which\n            amplification or electrical stimulation alone can restore\n            effortless speech understanding. By identifying markers of\n            early neural decline and linking them to listening effort,\n            this line of work provides a framework for developing new\n            fitting strategies, individualized signal processing\n            approaches, and clinical assessments that move beyond the\n            audiogram. Collectively, understanding the neural basis of\n            speech perception challenges in midlife will help us\n            optimize hearing aid and cochlear implant outcomes by\n            targeting the specific deficits that current devices cannot\n            fully resolve.\n            During my PhD studies, I was awarded a $145,000\n            fellowship from the National Institutes of Health to promote\n            diversity in biomedical research to investigate speech\n            perception in noise in middle-aged adults, and I was also\n            supported by a NIH Institutional Training Grant in Auditory\n            and Vestibular Neuroscience that led to this work.

(^co-first\n            authors).\n            \n            Diagnostic Development and Rehabilitative Approaches for\n            Hidden Hearing Loss\n            \n            \n            Traditional audiometry often misses early neural deficits\n            that may contribute to hearing difficulties. This line of\n            work aims to address this unmet clinical need by developing\n            non-invasive diagnostic tools that can assay neural speech\n            processing abilities in the absence of hearing loss on an\n            audiogram.This research was inspired by a study that I\n            co-led, where I retrospectively analyzed 50,000 audiology\n            patient records from the University of Pittsburgh Medical\n            Center clinics. We found that 15% of patients had normal\n            hearing thresholds in both ears, and nearly half of these\n            patients had chief complaints of speech perception in noise\n            difficulties (Cancel, McHaney et al., 2023). We found that\n            scores on the Words in Noise test, Randomized Dichotic\n            Digits Test, and QuickSIN, combined with a normal audiogram,\n            reliably identified patients who received a referral for an\n            auditory processing disorder diagnosis. These results\n            provided strong evidence to support a rapid screener for\n            auditory processing disorder in patients with chief\n            complaints of speech-in-noise difficulties in the absence of\n            hearing loss.\n            To translate mechanistic insights into potential\n            rehabilitation, I have investigated whether neuromodulation\n            strategies such as vagus nerve stimulation could enhance\n            speech processing difficulties. In Llanos, McHaney et al.,\n            2020, we used transcutaneous vagus nerve stimulation (tVNS)\n            as a method for enhancing behavioral attention to\n            harder-to-learn non-native speech sounds. I then used\n            pupillometry in McHaney et al., 2021 and 2023 to gauge the\n            mechanism of action for tVNS-induced behavioral enhancement.\n            My work with tVNS and pupillometry demonstrates that\n            neuromodulation can enhance speech processing and modulate\n            the cognitive effort needed for listening. These findings\n            have implications for enhancing attention to speech sounds\n            for speech perception in noise difficulties.\n            Associated References:\n            Llanos, F., McHaney, J.

With increasing age, speech perception in noise\n            is associated with increased activity in a compensatory\n            network of frontal-motor regions and reduced activity in\n            core auditory sensory-perceptual network. In short, when\n            listening to speech in noise, younger adults rely on clear\n            and stable (bottom-up) speech representations in core\n            auditory regions and older adults tend to leverage\n            higher-level (top-down) compensatory mechanisms that require\n            additional working memory and cognitive resources. While\n            neuroimaging methodologies have the potential to identify\n            compensatory network changes, these methods are not a\n            scalable solution for clinical diagnostics. In this line of\n            work, I aim to understand the sensory-cognitive deficits\n            that drive speech perceptual challenges under different\n            listening conditions using neurobiologically-grounded\n            computational approaches that model behavior. The\n            overarching goal is to develop behavioral-based assessments\n            of speech perception in noise abilities that can complement\n            clinical audiology to inform rehabilitation approaches and\n            counseling.\n            Associated References:\n            McHaney, J.

(^co-first\n              authors).\n              \n              Diagnostic Development and Rehabilitative Approaches for\n              Hidden Hearing Loss\n              \n              \n              Traditional audiometry often misses early neural\n              deficits that may contribute to hearing difficulties. This\n              line of work aims to address this unmet clinical need by\n              developing non-invasive diagnostic tools that can assay\n              neural speech processing abilities in the absence of\n              hearing loss on an audiogram.This research was inspired by\n              a study that I co-led, where I retrospectively analyzed\n              50,000 audiology patient records from the University of\n              Pittsburgh Medical Center clinics. We found that 15% of\n              patients had normal hearing thresholds in both ears, and\n              nearly half of these patients had chief complaints of\n              speech perception in noise difficulties (Cancel, McHaney\n              et al., 2023). We found that scores on the Words in Noise\n              test, Randomized Dichotic Digits Test, and QuickSIN,\n              combined with a normal audiogram, reliably identified\n              patients who received a referral for an auditory\n              processing disorder diagnosis. These results provided\n              strong evidence to support a rapid screener for auditory\n              processing disorder in patients with chief complaints of\n              speech-in-noise difficulties in the absence of hearing\n              loss.\n              To translate mechanistic insights into potential\n              rehabilitation, I have investigated whether\n              neuromodulation strategies such as vagus nerve stimulation\n              could enhance speech processing difficulties. In Llanos,\n              McHaney et al., 2020, we used transcutaneous vagus nerve\n              stimulation (tVNS) as a method for enhancing behavioral\n              attention to harder-to-learn non-native speech sounds. I\n              then used pupillometry in McHaney et al., 2021 and 2023 to\n              gauge the mechanism of action for tVNS-induced behavioral\n              enhancement. My work with tVNS and pupillometry\n              demonstrates that neuromodulation can enhance speech\n              processing and modulate the cognitive effort needed for\n              listening. These findings have implications for enhancing\n              attention to speech sounds for speech perception in noise\n              difficulties.\n              Associated References:\n              Llanos, F., McHaney, J.

With increasing age, speech perception in\n              noise is associated with increased activity in a\n              compensatory network of frontal-motor regions and reduced\n              activity in core auditory sensory-perceptual network. In\n              short, when listening to speech in noise, younger adults\n              rely on clear and stable (bottom-up) speech\n              representations in core auditory regions and older adults\n              tend to leverage higher-level (top-down) compensatory\n              mechanisms that require additional working memory and\n              cognitive resources. While neuroimaging methodologies have\n              the potential to identify compensatory network changes,\n              these methods are not a scalable solution for clinical\n              diagnostics. In this line of work, I aim to understand the\n              sensory-cognitive deficits that drive speech perceptual\n              challenges under different listening conditions using\n              neurobiologically-grounded computational approaches that\n              model behavior. The overarching goal is to develop\n              behavioral-based assessments of speech perception in noise\n              abilities that can complement clinical audiology to inform\n              rehabilitation approaches and counseling.\n              Associated References:\n              McHaney, J.

My long-term research\n              goal is to develop neurobiologically informed\n              rehabilitative and individualized approaches for speech\n              perception in noise difficulties in adults with\n              subclinical hearing loss.\n              I have secured over $1 million in funding, with the\n              majority to investigate speech perception challenges in\n              aging and in individuals who complain of speech perception\n              difficulties but have clinically-normal hearing\n              thresholds.\n              In my spare time, you’ll find me outdoors with my\n              husband, kids, and dog, no matter the season!\n              \n              \n              Education\n              University of Pittsburgh |\n              Pittsburgh, PA PhD, Communication\n              Science and Disorders\n              The University of Texas at Austin\n              | Austin, TX BS, Psychology\n              Austin Community College | Austin,\n              TX AS, General Studies in\n              Science\n              \n              \n              Funding\n              Ryan Family Research Acceleration\n              Funds Role: Co-Principal Investigator\n              February 2025-January 2026 | $242,474 Northwestern\n              University | Neura-Speech: Bridging the Diagnostic Gap\n              for Hidden Hearing Loss Through Electrophysiological\n              Speech Markers\n              Early Career Researcher R21\n              Role: Co-Investigator (PI: Lau) July 2024 - June\n              2027 | $600,000 NIH-NIDCD | R21DC022031 - The Role\n              of Context in the Neural Processing of Speech in Autism\n              Spectrum Disorder\n              NRSA Individual Predoctoral Fellowship to\n              Promote Diversity in Health-Related Research\n              Role: Principal Investigator May 2022 - April 2023\n              | $145,608 NIH-NIDCD | F31DC020085 - Neural\n              Mechanisms of Speech Perception in Noise in\n              Middle-Age\n              University of Pittsburgh Clinical and\n              Translational Science Institute Quantitative Methodologies\n              Pilot Program Role: Co-Principal Investigator\n              February 2022 - January 2023 | $25,000 NIH-NCATS |\n              UL1TR001857 - Decision Strategies in Speech Perception\n              in Aging\n              NRSA Institutional Training in Auditory and\n              Vestibular Neuroscience Role: Trainee\n              September 2019-August 2021 | $85,252 NIH-NIDCD |\n              T32DC011499\n              \n            \n        \n      \n    \n\n    \n    \n    ",
