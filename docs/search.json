Below, you’ll find a synopsis\n            of these projects and my contributions.\n            \n            Neural Mechanisms of Speech Perception in Aging\n            \n            \n            Speech perception in noise becomes increasingly difficult\n            with age. Even with normal hearing sensitivity, older adults\n            can vary widely in speech perception performance. Often\n            times speech perception difficulties become prominent in\n            middle-age (~40-55 years) when hearing thresholds are still\n            considered within clinically normal limits. A significant\n            contribution of my research has focused on the individual\n            differences underlying speech processing in middle-aged and\n            older adults while considering contributions from audibility\n            and cognition. I used a combination of neurophysiological,\n            computational, and machine learning methods to examine how\n            the neural mechanisms of speech perception change with\n            age.\n            During my PhD studies, I was awarded a $145,000\n            fellowship from the National Institutes of Health to\n            investigate speech perceptoin in noise in middle-aged\n            adults.
